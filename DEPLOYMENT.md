# Deploying the Interest Rate Dashboard

This guide explains how to deploy the dashboard to the web so others can access it without installing anything on their computers.

## Option 1: Render.com (Recommended)

Render.com offers a free tier that works well for this dashboard.

### Steps for Render Deployment:

1. **Create a GitHub Repository**:
   - Create a new repository on GitHub
   - Upload all your dashboard files to this repository
   - Make sure to include:
     - `advanced_dashboard.py`
     - `requirements.txt` 
     - `render.yaml`
     - `Rev_IR.xlsx` (your data file)

2. **Create a Render Account**:
   - Go to [render.com](https://render.com/) and sign up for a free account
   - Connect your GitHub account

3. **Deploy Your Dashboard**:
   - In Render, go to Dashboard
   - Click "New" and select "Blueprint"
   - Connect to your GitHub repository
   - Render will automatically detect the `render.yaml` configuration
   - Click "Apply Blueprint"
   - Wait for deployment to complete (5-10 minutes)

4. **Access Your Dashboard**:
   - Once deployment is complete, Render will provide a URL like `https://interest-rate-dashboard.onrender.com`
   - Share this URL with your manager

### What Your Manager Will See:

- A fully functional dashboard they can interact with
- All features will work exactly as they do on your local machine
- No installation required - they just need a web browser

## Option 2: Streamlit Community Cloud

If you prefer, you can convert the dashboard to Streamlit and deploy it for free:

1. Install Streamlit: `pip install streamlit`
2. Create a Streamlit version of the dashboard
3. Push to GitHub
4. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io/) to deploy

## Option 3: Hosting on Your Computer (Temporary)

For a quick temporary solution, you can:

1. Run the dashboard on your computer: `python advanced_dashboard.py`
2. Install ngrok: [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com/)
3. In a separate terminal: `ngrok http 8050`
4. Share the ngrok URL with your manager
5. Keep your computer running while they view the dashboard

## Troubleshooting

- **If the dashboard doesn't load**: Check the logs in Render to see what's happening
- **If data doesn't display**: Make sure your Excel file is properly uploaded
- **For memory issues**: Render's free tier has limited memory, so simplify the dashboard if needed
